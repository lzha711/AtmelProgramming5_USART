USART basic practices

Currently working on this repository. What have been done: 

1. Transmit characters and strings to the PC (virtual terminal in Proteus) through USART. Source code--Transmit_Only.c
2. Echo the received characters or strings back to the PC (virtual terminal in Proteus), no interrupt is used. Souce code -- Tx_Rx_echo_no_interrupt.c  
3. ADC conversion of an analog input (potentiometer) and display the result on PC (virtual terminal) in decimal format (0-255). Interrupt used in this example. Source -- ADC_USART_interrupt_based.c

Next to do is to test it on hardware.
